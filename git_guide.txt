1. Make Home Directory for SShH keys.
c://users/UserName/.SSH (for Windows 7)

2. Generate SSH key by command:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "user@mail.ru"
# Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

It's created a pair of keys -  private and public in home dir .SSH
C:\Users\SuvorovAG\.ssh\id_rsa
C:\Users\SuvorovAG\.ssh\id_rsa.pub

3. You must creat file with a name "config" in SSH Home dir
touch ~/.ssh/config

4. Put the strings bellow  to the config file by notepad for example
Host github.com
HostName github.com
Port 22
IdentityFile /c/users/username/.ssh/id_rsa

6. Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:

If you are using Git Bash, turn on ssh-agent:

# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566

7. Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent. If you used an existing SSH key rather than generating a new SSH key,
you'll need to replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your existing private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

8. And than you must copy to clipboard SSH link from your repository
git@github.com:sample-username/sample-repo.git

9. Clone your repository
git clone git@github.com:sample-username/sample-repo.git

10. Testing your SSH connection
Open Git Bash.
Enter the following:

ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
provide shell access.
